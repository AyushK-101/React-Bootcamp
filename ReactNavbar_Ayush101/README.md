Steps performed:

# First we have to install React 

Visited the reactjs.org website and found the start commands :

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

# Then we erased the dafault content on the host 

Erased the contents of App.js and then removed files we did not have to use like vitalsJS and testSetupJS

# Went to React-Bootstrap and got Navbar from there

https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/components/navbar/#rb-docs-content

# Changed the Navbar options text

# Made a Component folder in src

Wrote simple export functions in AboutJS,HomeJS,ContactJS,NavigbarJS

# Got the React Router from the website 
https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/overview

install command : npm install react-router-dom@6

# Imported the components to AppJS and made final changes

Changed the 'a href' to 'as={Link}' in NavigBarJS and set the routes by importing relevant things form 'react-router-dom' and using 'BrowserRouter' and 'Route' tags
